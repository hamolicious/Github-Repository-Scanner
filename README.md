# Github-Repository-Scanner
I wrote this to test out my <a href="https://github.com/hamolicious/Console-Graphs">Console Graphs</a> <a href="https://github.com/hamolicious/Console-Graphs/blob/master/table_example.py">Table class</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/hamolicious/Github-Repository-Scanner/blob/master/scan_github_repos_stats.py">scan_github_repos_stats.py</a> file scans your public repositories and displays statistics about them. The <a href="https://github.com/hamolicious/Github-Repository-Scanner/blob/master/scan_github_repos_upkeep.py">scan_github_repos_upkeep.py</a> file I wrote because I always forget to add one of the things to my repositories so now I can see what I've missed.
